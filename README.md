# File-permissions-in-Linux
Examined and managed file permissions in a Linux environment for a research team at a large organization.

## Linux File Permissions Management

## Overview
This project was part of a Coursera activity focused on managing file permissions in Linux.  
The scenario involved securing files in a research team's directory by identifying incorrect permissions and applying the proper authorization using Linux commands.

## Activity Summary
Using commands such as `ls -la` and `chmod`, I:
- Checked existing file and directory permissions
- Interpreted permission strings
- Removed unauthorized write access
- Updated permissions on a hidden archived file
- Restricted access to a sensitive directory for the correct user

## Outcome
These changes ensured that only authorized users could read, write, or access sensitive project files, supporting secure file management within the Linux environment.
